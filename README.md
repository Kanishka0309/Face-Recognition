This project involves building an attendance system which utilizes facial recognition to mark the presence, time-in of employees. This project intends to serve as an efficient substitute for traditional manual attendance systems. It can be used in corporate offices, schools, and organizations where security is essential.

This project aims to automate the traditional attendance system where the attendance is marked manually. It also enables an organization to maintain its records like in-time, out time, break time and attendance digitally. 



SCOPE OF FACE RECOGNITIONâœ¨

Facial recognition is becoming more prominent in our society. It has made major progress in the field of security. It is a very effective tool that can help low enforcers to recognize criminals and software companies are leveraging the technology to help users access the technology. This technology can be further developed to be used in other avenues such as ATMs, accessing confidential files, or other sensitive materials. This project servers as a foundation for future projects based on facial detection and recognition. This project also convers web development and database management with a user-friendly UI. Using this system any corporate offices, school and organization can replace their traditional way of maintaining attendance of the employees and can also generate their availability(presence) report throughout the month.
